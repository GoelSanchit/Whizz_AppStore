# Whizz_AppStore
This application is not targeted at a specific person, group or user. The idea is to target each and every smartphone out there in the market. Our aim is to create an App Store which provides an interface to the user to access their favourite apps; but with somewhat less hocus-pocus. > At present Whizz includes 32 apps viz. Indian Railways, Delhi Metro, Yatra App, Medicina Store, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, Flipkart, Amazon, NewsHunt, etc. Our main objective is to provide the functionalities of a Mobile Software Distribution Platform, bundled up with some innovative ideas & features that would take the mobile experience to a whole new level for sure.

This is just a first step in the path of creating a market focused mobile application. We guys are looking forward to establish a start-up and IEF gives us just the right opportunity. With such a platform we are sure to get a boost in our efforts and endeavours.
**We conclude here by focusing on some of the key benefits of Whizz:**

• Whizz helps in reducing the RAM problem and that too, drastically..

• ‘Download one, access all apps’ is a unique feature of Whizz.

• No need of downloading a particular app.

• Works equally well on slow connections.

• A lot of time is saved since the user need not wait for the downloading to complete, then there is installation too. When others will be waiting for their app to be downloaded and installed, a Whizz user can simply access the app by ‘just a tap’.
